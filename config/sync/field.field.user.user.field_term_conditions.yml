All information from general visitors to the Website is anonymous and does not contain any Personal Data. The web server tracks domain names for security purposes and information regarding the nature and extent of the website's usage. This information is used to analyze trends for business purposes such as providing customer service, fraud prevention, market research and improving our Website. Please check your Web browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The VSCPA may collect Personal Data when it is voluntarily submitted by the user to process certain requests (such as registration for programs, membership dues, updates and other services). The VSCPA collects only the appropriate information needed to process the request voluntarily from the user. Some of the information voluntarily collected may include your name, email address, phone number, fax number, postal address, membership number, certification information and financial/credit card information. At no point does the VSCPA collect any of this information in an involuntary manner. All Personal Data obtained from users is treated with great care to protect your privacy and security. The information volunteered is kept confidential by the VSCPA and is not shared with unrelated outside parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From time to time, we may use your Personal Data to provide you with updates and other information. We also collect the email addresses of people who communicate with us via email.

These parties are not allowed to use your personal information except for the purpose of providing these services to the VSCPA and its members or customers, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. In addition, Personal Data is shared with third parties such as banks and credit-card processers to the extent necessary for the VSCPA to deliver payment processing services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To facilitate networking, the VSCPA makes contact information and other types of limited Personal Data available to <em>members and customers only</em> on password-secured areas of our Website and affiliated Websites. These areas include our Connect community, volunteer directories, the Find a CPA directory and others. Members and customers can <a href=\"http://connect.vscpa.com/profile/profilebase\">opt out</a> of the directories at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The VSCPA may disclose confidential Personal Data if made in response to a valid order of a court or authorized agency of government, and will work to establish a legal means to limit such disclosure and only disclose that segment of confidential information that legal counsel advises must be disclosed.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong id=\"Advertisements\">Advertisements</strong>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Links to Other Websites:</i> Any link (including a hyperlink, button or referral device of any kind) used on the VSCPA Website is provided for your use and convenience.
